Design:
Detail of Software used:
Frontend:
Html:
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded
into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated
by tags, written using angle brackets.
 HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
 HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
 HTML describes the structure of a Web page
 HTML consists of a series of elements
 HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
 HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is
a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
Css:
CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of
devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of
HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including
layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant
CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page
load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
Javascript:
JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side
and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and
CSS are languages that give structure and style .
JavaScript can be used in both the front-end and back-end of web
development. ... Chrome, the most used Internet browser in 2017, has been so
successful in part because of its ability to process JavaScript quickly.
Backend:
PHP:
PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Pre-processor". PHP is a server
side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic
content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites
PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and
interactive Web pages.
PHP is a widely-used, free, and efficient alternative to competitors such as Microsoft's ASP.
Mysql:
MySQL is a database management system.
It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast
amounts of information in a corporate network. To add, access, and process data
stored in a computer database, you need a database management system such
as MySQL Server.
The data in a MySQL database are stored in tables. Databases are useful for storing information categorically. A company may have a database with the following tables:
 Employees
 Products
 Customers
 Orders
Modules:
 Homepage
Signup:
The top right corner of the home page displays a signup option which consist of
register and login options. A customer is required to create an account before
buying or selling products/pets.
Register:
A costumer can register themselves by filling some basic detail. The register
page pop ups that asks for basic details such as name, email address dob etc. it
also asks the user to create a username and password which can be used during
login.
Login:
The customers who already created an account can log directly into their respective accounts by their username password. 
Post ad:
For customers who wish to sell their pets can click on post ad on the nav bar on
the home screen. A page pops up that asks basic details about the pet such as pet
name, its category, price of the pet, sellers address and its description if any. The
next part is to upload required documents and pictures of the pets. Upon submitting, the ad is posted on and is visible to every other customer on the pet ad
page.

supplies options give them access to a wide varieties of supplies from food to
beds. The costumers can view and choose the supplies best suited for their pets

Problems faced:
Working on the backend was a challenging part. Since we don’t have the
complete knowledge of the backend it was challenging to make the website work
very smoothly and resemble it to the closest to an actual professional website.
The second main problem was collaboration. Since we could not meet physically,
we couldn’t use a centralized system for our project. So, we had to send our files
to each other in order to collaborate. But the issue here was that the files running in one member’s system was not running on the other person’s system. We
took a while to resolve this issue.
Conclusion:
Our project is only a humble venture to satisfy the needs.
By using standard resources and tools, our visitors are able to view our web
pages no matter what browser they use. Our pages would load faster and we
would also be able to maintain the pages we have created with ease. This project
is designed provide the users the best facility when comfort when it comes to
easy and safe buying pet animals or products. It has been developed in Html, CSS
and JavaScript and the database has been built in PhpMyAdmin.
The user will be able to buy best quality pet products and necessities using this
website. The user can sell their pets easily without any hassle. PhpMyAdmin is
used as backend database since it is easier to maintain, user friendly and
provides fast data access, easy installation and simplicity. For front end we used
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Future scope:
We intend to make tails of joy a more user friendly website by adding many
features that will provide costumers utmost ease in buying and selling pets or
pet goods. We also aim to upgrade features to make it available to a wider array
of customers.
